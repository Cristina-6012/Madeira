        <h2>Madeira isn't actually an island</h2>
        <p class="Fact1">Madeira is often thought of as an island although it is actually an archipelago of four islands. 
        Technically the region of Madeira, the archipelago, is made up of four parts: Madeira, Porto Santo and two smaller archipelagos: 
        the three-island Desertas and the two-island Savage Islands.</p>

        <h2>Toboggan Rides: A Unique Downhill Thrill</h2>
        <p class="fact3">
            In the 19th century, residents of the hilltop village of Monte created a fast way to descend to Funchal—wicker toboggans on greased-up wooden runners! 
            Today, these wicker toboggans, steered by skilled drivers in traditional white costumes and special shoes, are a popular tourist attraction and a 
            fun way to experience Madeira's culture and history.
